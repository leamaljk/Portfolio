          <!-- Your initial content here... -->
          Hello and thank you for going the distance to meet me.
  My name is Lea, and I work under the name Pearl Design. 
  <br>
  Wonderful name, isn't it? ðŸ™‚
  You're probably wondering what that has to do with building website designs. Well, what does Apple have to do with electronics? ðŸ˜‰
  <br><br>
  Let me tell you a little bit more about myself...
  <br><br>
  I am also a mom of an adorable little girl, and the wife to a beloved husband. 
  <br><br>
  Before deciding to go freelancing...
  <br><br>
  Before my decision to freelance, I was always working as an employee "for someone", and this decision initially worried me to say the least because I can never know the outcome. 
  I felt secure in a company; they were take care of everything concerning me. No worries at all. 
  <!-- Put here the content that is visible before clicking "Read more" -->
        </p>

      </div>

    </section>
    <button @click="toggleShowMore" class="read-more-button">
          {{ showMore ? 'Read Less' : 'Read More' }}
        </button>
    <div v-if="showMore" class="additional-content">
          <p class="aboutMeText second-part">
<br><br>
  Becoming my own boss was a transformative journey, and I learned a new perspective on life. ðŸ™‚ With the right mindset and organizational skills, work and family can be well balanced. Every mom/parent will agree with me. 
  "Work could be woven into the fabric of family life, rather than being a separate garment to be worn only during 'office hours'."
  <br><br>
  Starting as a Sortation Associate at Amazon in December 2019 didn't seem unusual at that point, but a year later, when I became a permanent employee, things started to unravel for me. 
  Years before, I finished high school for a Web designer but didn't pursue it. Life took me to other places. I always wanted to pursue this kind of career, but it was never in my path. 
  Until that one year working for Amazon... They were offering various kinds of schools for dentists, nurses, IT sector, etc., including WEB DEVELOPER. Many different kinds of public and online schools worldwide. 
  That moment, I was amazed and was sure that this time I wouldn't miss the opportunity. 
  It took me 2 years to complete it. Some of the projects you may see below. Fantastic. Now I'm back on track.
  <br><br>
  My biggest passion is to help people like you and me to grow, because making this decision was hard enough, I want to make it easy for you. 
  I want to tell your story online. I'm not Steve Jobs, but I'm inspired by his philosophy. Because, why not? ðŸ¤· I also have projects and skills that speak for me. I'm absolutely excited to develop my skills and to take on new challenges.
  <br><br>
  Learning is part of life.. ðŸŽ“

    "Your time is limited, don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma â€“ which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary." - Steve Jobs
